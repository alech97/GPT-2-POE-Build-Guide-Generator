Caustic Arrow is a good addition to any DPS build, as the nice crit is mitigated by aura levels, and the projectile damage is at a reasonable distance (more than enough to one shot you in. The bow itself is still fine, but at least for now, I've decided not to bother trying to come up with a bow spec that works well with this build.\n",

So if you want to make it an accurate RF build, you can increase your life leech in the tooltip to 5% per stack, which will net you 12% increased energy shield for the cost of 2.5% life. This is only for the base build, but you could do it with some non-cast build. I don't know how the gear works, but if you go for the 6L you can get up to 10% life leech, so feel free to try it out.\n",
